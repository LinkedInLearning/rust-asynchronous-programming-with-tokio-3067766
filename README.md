This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Rust: Asynchronous Programming with Tokio. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![Rust: Asynchronous Programming with Tokio][lil-thumbnail-url] 

Asynchronous programming is becoming the de facto coding paradigm of Rust. In this course, senior software engineer and content creator Marcus Willock covers what you need to know about using Tokio, the asynchronous primitives it offers, and the channels it provides. Find out what asynchronous programming is and when to use it. Learn the basics of the asynchronous runtime in Tokio, as well as how to spawn a task, how to test asynchronous code, and more. Explore asynchronous primitives, including mutex, semaphore, notify, barrier, and RwLock. Plus, go over channels, what they are, and how you can use them.
